# Auth service

This is a service that can be put in-between a 3Scale API Management installation and a RH SSO/Keycloak instance. It intercepts the OpenID connect flow and performs extra authorization checks (based on role claims in the issued token) and calls the 3Scale API to set the correct section accesses based on the defined roles.

## Building the jar and image

Prerequisites: oc command line utility with connection to an OpenShift cluster.

```bash
oc project *namespace-to-deploy-in*
cicd/build.sh
``` 

Run the openshift build script

## Installation

First build the image by following the instructions in the previous section.

Update the information in the supplied configmap template and deploy:

```bash
vi openshift/cm.yml
oc create -f openshift/cm.yml
```

Then deploy the service:

```bash
oc new-app -f openshift/authsvc.yml
```
